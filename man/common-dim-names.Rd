\title{Find common dimension names}
\usage{
rray_dim_names_common(...)

rray_dim_names2(x, y)
}
\description{
Obtain a common list of dimension names among a set of objects. For
interactive use, \code{rray_dim_names_common()} will be more useful.
}
\details{
\code{rray_dim_names_common()} is the engine that determines what dim names should
be used in the result of arithmetic operations and other functions that
involve multiple rray or mtrx objects and return a single result.

The rules for determining the set of common dim names between objects
\code{x} and \code{y} (in that order) are:
\enumerate{
\item Compute the common \code{dim} between \code{x} and \code{y} using \code{rray_dim_common()}.
\item For each dimension along the common \code{dim}, if \code{x} has dim names for that
specific dimension and the size of the names is the same as the size
of the dimension, use them.
\item If \code{y} has dim names for that dimension, and the size of the names
is the same as the size of the dimension, use them.
\item If there are no dim names found, then the result is \code{character(0)}.
}
}
\examples{

# Row names but no column names
x <- rray(1, dim = c(1, 2), dim_names = list("r1", character()))
