\title{Build a mtrx object}
\usage{
mtrx(...)
}
\description{
Helpful constructor for building mtrx objects. Pass in named vectors,
where each vector represents a single column in the mtrx. Length \code{1}
vectors are recycled.
}
\details{
No rownames are allowed for mtrx objects.

mtrx objects are never reduced to vectors when subsetting using \code{[}.
}
\examples{

a_mtrx <- mtrx(a = 1:5, b = 6:10)

# first column
a_mtrx[1]
a_mtrx["a"]
a_mtrx[,1]
a_mtrx[,"a"]

# first row
a_mtrx[1,]

# single element
a_mtrx[1, 1]

# multiple columns
a_mtrx[, c("a", "b")]

}
