\title{Create a new mtrx}
\usage{
new_mtrx(.data = numeric(0), size = 0L, shape = 1L,
  dim_names = NULL, ..., subclass = character(0))
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{A numeric vector with no attributes representing
the data.}

\item{size}{An integer. The number of \emph{observations} in the object.
This is equivalent to the number of rows.}

\item{shape}{A single integer specifying the number of columns in the mtrx.}

\item{dim_names}{A list. For no names, \code{NULL}, in which case a list of
empty characters will be constructed. Otherwise the list must
be the same length as the total number of dimensions
(i.e \code{length(c(size, shape))}). Each element of the list much be either
a character vector the same size as the corresponding dimension, or
\code{character(0)} for no names for that dimension.}

\item{...}{Name-value pairs defining attributes.}

\item{subclass}{The name of the subclass.}
}
\description{
Low level constructor for mtrx objects
}

mtrx_ex <- new_mtrx(1:10, size = 5L, shape = 2L, col_names = c("a", "b"))
