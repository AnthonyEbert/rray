\title{Find common dimensions}
\usage{
rray_dims_common(..., .dims = NULL)

rray_dim_common(..., .dims = NULL)
}
\description{
\itemize{
\item \code{rray_dims2()} finds the common dimensionality among two objects.
\item \code{rray_dim2()} finds the common size of each dimension of two objects.
\item \code{rray_dims_common()} and \code{rray_dim_common()} are extensions that take
multiple inputs.
}
}
\details{
\code{rray_dims_common()} essentially takes the maximum dimensionality of the inputs. This
is the "common" dimensionality. This is different from recycling
rules. Where comparing dimensionalities of 2 and 3 would throw an error
with tidy recycling rules, the common dimensionality of these is really 3,
because the 2D object has an implicit 3rd dimension of size 1.

\code{rray_dim_common()} finds the common dimensionality,
makes any implicit dimensions explicit, then recycles the size of each
dimension to a common size.

\examples{

x_1_by_4 <- matrix(1, nrow = 1, ncol = 4)
x_5_by_1 <- matrix(1, nrow = 5, ncol = 1)

# these are both 2D
rray_dims_common(x_1_by_4, x_5_by_1)

# recycle rows: 1 and 4 = 4
# recycle cols: 5 and 1 = 5
rray_dim_common(x_1_by_4, x_5_by_1)

x_5_by_1_by_3 <- array(1, c(5, 1, 3))

# recycle rows:  1 and 4 = 4
# recycle cols:  5 and 1 = 5
# recycle depth: 1 and 3 = 3
# (here, depth of 1 for the matrix is implicit)
rray_dim_common(x_1_by_4, x_5_by_1_by_3)
